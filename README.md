# MCNES

Welcome to the MCNES, a NES emulator written in C! This project is an open-source NES emulator that aims to be accurate and simple to use. The emulator is currently under development and nothing is currently functional, but the goal is to create a high-quality, open-source NES emulator that is easy to use.

# Current state

The codebase is currently a blank slate and contributions and suggestions are welcome. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0, which means that any derivative works of the code must also be released under the same license.

# Build

This project is in its early development phase, therefore, the code is not yet functional and cannot be built yet. We are actively working on the development and will update the repository once there is something to show. Feel free to check the code and open issues, but please do not expect it to work at this stage.

# Goals
The emulator is being developed with C programming language, and we are aiming to support multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux and MacOS.

# Feedback

The project is still in its early stages, so we are open to feedback, suggestions and contributions. If you're interested in contributing, please take a look at the code and the open issues. You can also contact us if you have any questions or want to discuss the project further.

Thank you for your interest in the MCNES, the NES emulator!
