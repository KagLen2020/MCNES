Welcome

Welcome to the NES emulator written in C! This project is an open-source NES emulator that aims to be accurate and efficient. The emulator is currently under development and nothing is currently functional, but the goal is to create a high-quality, open-source NES emulator that is easy to use.

The codebase is currently a blank slate and contributions and suggestions are welcome. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0, which means that any derivative works of the code must also be released under the same license.

The emulator is being developed with C programming language, and we are aiming to support multiple platforms. We are also focused on providing a good performance and low latency, that's why we are using modern techniques such as multi-threading, dynamic recompilation and other advanced techniques.

The project is still in its early stages, so we are open to feedback, suggestions and contributions. If you're interested in contributing, please take a look at the code and the open issues. You can also contact us if you have any questions or want to discuss the project further.

Thank you for your interest in the NES emulator!
